##### The Dao of Immutability (The Way of the Functional Programmer)

> “Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function.”

> “Is it not true that the word for ‘not functional’ is ‘dysfunctional’?”

- Immutability

> The true constant is change. Mutation hides change. Hidden change manifests chaos. Therefore, the wise embrace history.

- Separation

> Logic is thought. Effects are action. Therefore the wise think before acting, and act only when the thinking is done.

> Keep functions small. Do one thing at a time, and do it well.

- Composition

> Plan for composition. Write functions whose outputs will naturally work as inputs to many other functions. Keep function signatures as simple as possible.

- Flow

> A list expressed over time is a stream.

> Shared objects and data fixtures can cause functions to interfere with each other. Threads competing for the same resources can trip each other up. A program can be reasoned about and outcomes predicted only when data flows freely through pure functions.
